# Note Taker

## Description

- I create this app to store notes on a database and host on a live server so I can access them from anywhere on any machine.
- This allowed me to practice express development using GET, POST and DELETE requests/responses
- This intorduced the concepts of databases and how to make persistant data that can be accessed off of the local machine the app is being run on
- I was able to utilize modular routing to increase code legibility and make future development easier
- I was able to learn basics of utilizing the req.params property to create the delete function
